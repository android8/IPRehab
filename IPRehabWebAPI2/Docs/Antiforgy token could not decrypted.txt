During the deployment of ASP.NET 5, there is an error "error the antiforgy token could not be decrypted. The key {guid} WAS NOT FOUND in the key ring"

ERROR 2021-02-25 20:39:28,460 [16   ] spNetCore.Antiforgery.DefaultAntiforgery - An exception was thrown while deserializing the token.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.AntiforgeryValidationException: The antiforgery token could not be decrypted.
 ---> System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The key {238a0f63-439d-4e88-883b-002c09902988} was not found in the key ring.

 Go to Google checking it, saying that the ASP.NET Core prevented the cause of the cross-site request for the forgery mechanism, and the procedure should not be the problem of the program. Later, in an abroad post, I need to define Machine Key, If IIS7.5 or if you want to apply a dedicated, you need to define it in Web.config. Otherwise, it can be defined directly in the IIS server layer.

 IIS Managment Console
 1. Click Machine Key in ASP.NET (group by AREA)
 2. After clicking in, if you apply a full server, you need to select two check boxes for "Automatical Generate At Runtime" & "Automatic Or Generate At Runtime".
 3. In the Itentity Advanced Settings, set Load User Profile to True
